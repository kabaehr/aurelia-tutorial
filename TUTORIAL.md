# Tutorial
## Introduction
### Why Aurelia?

Taken from [here](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/technical-benefits/1):
- Use modern JavaScript and TypeScript - fully written in standards-based ES 2015 and ES 2016
- Designed to work with modern ES 2015-oriented package managers like JSPM.
- Intended to be used with modern transpilers such as Babel and TypeScript.
- Leverages standards-compliant Web Components specs such as HTMLTemplateElement and ShadowDOM
- Highly modular development, suitable for large-scale apps
- Designed for modern web browsers.
- Adds polyfills to support older browsers, such as IE9.
- Fully-extensible and adaptive data-binding engine.
- Powerful and flexible hierarchical dependency injection.
- Leverage conventions to write less code and get more done.
- Little to no framework intrusion, so developers can focus on their app, not the framework.
- Application and package bundling compatible with any build system.

### Requirements

In this tutorial we will primarily be using the Aurelia CLI. Prerequisites for this are 
- NodeJS version 4.x or above
- Git

Once you have those prerequisites installed you can install the Aurelia CLI itself by running the following command on the command line:

`npm install aurelia-cli -g`

## Basic tutorial

### 1. Creating and running a new app

1. Run `au new` on the command line. Take option `2. Default TypeScript` and accept all other defaults.
2. Change directory to the newly created `aurelia-app` folder and run `au run --watch`.
3. Wait for the build to be finished, open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). You should see a web page displaying "Hello World!".

### 2. Router setup and first module

4. Replace `<h1>${message}</h1>` in `app.html` with `<router-view></router-view>`.
5. Add `configureRouter(config, router)` function in `app.ts` and remove the message. Full code for the function:

```
  configureRouter(config: RouterConfiguration, router: Router): void {
    this.router = router;
    config.title = 'Aurelia';
    config.map([
      { route: ['', 'todo'], name: 'todo-list', moduleId: 'routes/todo/todo' },
      { route: 'todo/add', name: 'add-todo', moduleId: 'routes/todo/add' }
    ]);
  }
```

6. Add `routes/todo/todo.html` with the following content:

```
<template>
    <h3>Todos</h3>
</template>
```

7. Add `routes/todo/todo.ts` with the following content:

```
export class Todo {
}
```
